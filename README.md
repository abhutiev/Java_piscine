# Java_piscine

Realisation of exercices can be very shitty in this repo (especially in first days), but it's only because subjects were very strict, for example in day00/ex00 loops and conditions are forbidden etc.
This repo is public because it's important in my opinion for Github account to show progress of its owner, not because i believe i wrote on Java miracles, world should see.
